		<h1>Hi, I’m Kyle. I’m a music producer.</h1>
		<h2>I use the following software:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Ableton Live</li>
			<li>Avid Pro Tools</li>
			<li>Adobe Audition</li>
		</ul>
		<p>What excites me most about production is collaboration with others. There is no better feeling than sitting down with a musician and sensing chemistry between their ideas and mine.</p>
		<p><em>My ultimate goal every time I start a project is to translate musical ideas into a fully-realized track that is both original and professional.</em></p>
		<p>In high school I began collecting hardware samplers and records and attending shows in the greater Boston area. What started as a casual interest quickly became a full-time pursuit.</p>
		<p>Since then, I have produced dozens of tracks, exchanged project files with collaborators across the world, and DJed a handful of events and parties.</p>
		<p><strong>I am currently exploring interactive web technology as a means of creating a more immersive audiovisual experience.</strong></p>
